## Background
I finished building the epPlex<insert link> MVP, then I was looking for some use-cases and AdDrop came to mind with ephemeral NFTs as ads.

So for AdDrop I had to showcase epPlex, although I'm not strictly married to epNFTs for this idea.

## MVP
- Ad creator can create a campaign
- AdDrop distributes epNFT
- Ad consumer can answer survey to get rewards

## Tech stack
- NFTs: epPlex
- NestJS Backend (hosted on railway.app)
- NextJS Frontend (hosted on vercel)
- Postgres DB (Supabase)
