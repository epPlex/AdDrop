## Background & credits
I wanted to learn NestJS as a backend, so I decided to do this project last minute the day before the OPOS deadline lol.

Huge shoutout to the clean-code writer [Josip Volarevic](https://twitter.com/JosipVolarevic2) for open sourcing the dReader backend [https://github.com/d-reader-organization/d-reader-backend](https://github.com/d-reader-organization/d-reader-backend). This was a MAJOR help in my learning journey (pretty much copied everything from here xD).

## Current implementation
- Frontend and backend setup
- Can create Sphere Products
- Can display the products

## Future work
- Make frontend cleaner
- Get search to work
- Purchase products through Sphere
- Merchant setup
- And much more

## Tech stack
- NFTs: epPlex
- NestJS Backend (hosted on railway.app)
- NextJS Frontend (hosted on vercel)
- Postgres DB (Supabase)
